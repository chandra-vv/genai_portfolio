# 🧠 LangGraph Multi-Agent Assistant

This project implements an advanced **Multi-Agent AI Assistant** using **LangGraph** and **LangChain**.  
It is designed to handle complex user queries by decomposing them into smaller tasks, retrieving relevant knowledge using embeddings and vector databases, and orchestrating execution through a graph-based workflow.

Unlike single-chain chatbots, this assistant follows an **agentic architecture** that supports planning, retrieval, memory, and intelligent routing. An interactive **Streamlit UI** allows users to experiment with the system and optionally query custom documents.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build a production-style multi-agent system using LangGraph
- Demonstrate query planning and task decomposition
- Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Maintain conversation memory and context
- Provide an interactive UI for experimentation and learning

## ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture orchestrated using LangGraph  
- 🧠 Planner Agent to break complex queries into sub-questions  
- 🔍 Retriever Agent powered by embeddings and FAISS  
- 🎛️ Controller logic to route queries based on complexity  
- 💾 Conversation memory for contextual continuity  
- 📄 Optional document upload for custom knowledge  
- 🎨 Interactive Streamlit interface  
- ⚡ Powered by OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo

## 🧩 System Architecture

The assistant is implemented as a **graph of nodes**, where each node has a clearly defined responsibility.

### Core Components

- **Planner Agent**  
  Decomposes complex user queries into smaller, focused sub-questions.

- **Retriever Agent**  
  Answers questions using embeddings and FAISS-based vector similarity search.

- **Controller (Graph Logic)**  
  Determines execution flow:
  - Complex queries → Planner → Retriever (loop) → End  
  - Simple queries → Retriever → End  

- **Memory Node**  
  Stores and displays conversation context across turns.

---

## 🔄 Execution Flow

1. User submits a query through the Streamlit UI  
2. Graph classifies the query as simple or complex  
3. Planner agent generates sub-questions (if required)  
4. Retriever agent answers using embeddings + FAISS  
5. LangGraph orchestrates execution and state updates  
6. Conversation memory is updated  
7. Final answers are displayed in the UI

## 📘 Example

**Input Question**

How do embeddings improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**Generated Sub-Questions**
- What are embeddings?
- What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?
- How do embeddings enable semantic search?

**Sample Output**
- Embeddings represent text as numerical vectors capturing semantic meaning.  
- In RAG systems, embeddings enable similarity-based retrieval of relevant documents.
